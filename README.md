 - 👋 Hi, I’m @anhdoan0810
 - 👀 I’m interested in CAE simulation, vehicle safety, crashworthiness, and design optimization – especially in the automotive sector.
 - 🌱 I’m currently building my skills in passive safety simulations (e.g., head impact, frontal crash) using LS-Dyna, ANSA, and optimization tools. 
 - I'm creating my own open projects to explore crash simulations and share insights with the community.
 - 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on simulation projects focused on FEM, occupant safety, and crash analysis.

 - 😄 Pronouns: she/her
 - ⚡ Fun fact: I once optimized a car part design in two conflicting simulations – maximizing stiffness in one and compliance in another – and made it work!


Sample model must be rotated!!!!!!!!!!! FMVSS
